# QuickTweet
A python app to tweet and find tweets using SMS!

# Inspiration
Ever since the recent COVID-19 pandemic, most of us, not surprisingly, have been spending a lot more time on the internet, which includes many websites like Twitter, Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, and many others. This inspired me to create a much faster and convenient way of tweeting and finding tweets only using your phone's SMS so that you don't have to open your browser, wait for the internet to connect and log in every time you want to tweet something or even find a tweet. 

# What it does
Simply send and SMS to an assigned number and it will tweet your message from your account, or, if you begin your SMS with '~hashtag', it will find the top 5 tweets with the same hashtag as the rest of your SMS. For example, '~hashtag tech' will find the top 5 tweets with the tech hashtag.
